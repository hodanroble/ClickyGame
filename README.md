# ClickyGame
This is a memory game created with React.
The application renders different images to the screen. It keeps track of the user's score. The user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffles themselves in a random order. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
